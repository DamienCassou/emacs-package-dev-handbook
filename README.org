After developing some little Emacs packages for a year or so, I began to notice how I'd forget little things that I learned, and then I'd have to go hunting for that information again.  I also noticed how there are some issues for which there doesn't seem to be a "best practice" or "Standard Operating Procedure" to refer to.

So this is intended to be a place to collect and organize information related to Emacs package development.  Built with Emacs, by Emacs package developers, for Emacs package developers.

***** TODO Autoloading macro-generated functions

This may actually be a bug, or at least an unanswered question.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/63u5yn/how_to_use_autoload_cookies_for_custom_defunlike/][How to use autoload cookies for custom defun-like macros? : emacs]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Say I have a macro =deffoo= that expands to some custom kind of =defun=, and I want to use an autoload cookie to autoload the result. According to the manual,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ;;;###autoload (deffoo bar   ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

copies the entire form to =autoloads.el=, and something like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ;;;###autoload (autoload 'bar "this-file") (deffoo bar   ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

should be used instead. What confuses me is [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/38805102][this StackOverflow comment]] by who appears to be Stefan Monnier, saying that Emacs /should/ expand the macro before generating the autoload, and that it's probably a bug when this does not happen.

Can anyone clear up what the intended behaviour is?

**** Integration with other packages

***** Optional support

Sometimes you want your package to integrate with other packages, but you don't want to require users to install those other packages.  For example, you might want your package to work with Helm, Ivy, or the built-in Emacs =completing-read=, but you don't want to declare a dependency on and =require= Helm or Ivy, which would force users to install them to use your package.

The best way to handle this is with the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Hooks-for-Loading.html][=with-eval-after-load=]] macro.  The [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Hooks-for-Loading.html][Emacs manual]] has a page on it, and [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21880139/what-is-with-eval-after-load-in-emacs-lisp][this StackOverflow question]] has some more info.  You can also see an [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-recent-headings/blob/master/org-recent-headings.el#L350][example]], which also [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-recent-headings/blob/master/org-recent-headings.el#L377][uses]] [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Declaring-Functions.html][=declare-function=]] to prevent byte-compiler errors.

Pattern matching is invaluable in elisp. Lists are ubiquitous, and a small amount of pattern matching can often replace a ton of verbose list fiddling.

Since this is Lisp, we have lots of choices! In this post, we'll compare [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/cl.html][cl.el]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Pattern-matching-case-statement.html][pcase.el]], [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]], and [[https://github.com/VincentToups/shadchen-el][shadchen]], so you can choose the best fit for your project. We'll look at the most common use cases, and end with some recommendations.

For the sake of this post, we'll consider both pattern matching and destructuring, as they're closely related concepts.
